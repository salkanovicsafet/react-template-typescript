# React Typescript template

This is a React Typescript template that I use to bootstrap my projects and set up my desired project structure. You're free to use it if you like. No attribution needed.

## Available Scripts

Once you have it, just install all the dependencies by running this command:

### `npm install`

and you're ready to go :)

This template comes with React router, ESLint and a bunch of other useful stuff.
